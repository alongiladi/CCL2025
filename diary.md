13.1 - finishied with my background and player animation
14.1 - finished with my enemy animation and collision detection
  15.1 - terrible! i basically have to restart. tried to do a more complex correct collision detection the whole day and didn't succeded, turns out my understanding of that Draw function is flawd (put too much code into it). starting again!
  16.1 - ok, today was a bit better. i have done a bit of course correction and decided to make my game a bit more simple so i can reach the appropriate dealines. i have decided to go for a side sroll style game where the player needs to hover and jump through obsticales while gathering points. i have built the basic infrastructre (player and game objects, score board and collision detection( and it works preety well. tommorow i will add points logic and gameOver option. things are looking up!
