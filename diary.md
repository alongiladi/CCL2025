13.1 - finishied with my background and player animation
14.1 - finished with my enemy animation and collision detection
  15.1 - terrible! i basically have to restart. tried to do a more complex correct collision detection the whole day and didn't succeded, turns out my understanding of that Draw function is flawd (put too much code into it). after a long consulting session with the tutors, it seems like the only real possibiilty is to start over. god help me.
  16.1 - ok, today was a bit better. i have done a bit of course correction and decided to make my game a bit more simple so i can reach the appropriate dealines. i have decided to go for a side sroll style game where the player needs to hover and jump through obsticales while gathering points. i have built the basic infrastructre (player and game objects, score board and collision detection( and it works preety well. tommorow i will add points logic and gameOver option. things are looking up!
16.1 -   gameover function finished, still a bit bugy with the points though
17.1 - ponit calculation a bit bugy but i'll solve it buy making each pipe only a half point ` started working on the spaceship drawing
18.1 - ponits work and spaceship drawn almost fully. starting to twick to gravity and acceleration when jumping and moving to the sides
19. delta time not working properly with the Y velocity, don't understand why, spent most of the day on it
20 - ran into a number of problems - most of them solved by wrong syntax but the game is still crashing and the animation completly not orgnized, dont know how to solve it
21 - the problem yesterday was wrong order in code, i put some stuff inside the draw function that should have been outside, and vice verse. working mornally now
22 - finished drawing spaceship but havn't got the time i needed to draw an enemy. would try to establish some ground structre today before i make the pitch, i hope i'll make it. if not, i have at least a working game
